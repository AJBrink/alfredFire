Alfred State Fire Department new website for 2014

This is a final project to help a non-profit orginization. For our project we chose to redo the website of the alfred fire department at http://www.alfredfire.org/

To make a new folder click the + symbol next ot alfredFire/ and name it your name. Here you can put your fils for your template. When we get to creating actuall webpages after we picked the template we can then put the pages on the master folder so the final finished project will be in the same folder.
